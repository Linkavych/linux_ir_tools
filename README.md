# Linux Incident Response Tool Builder

A simple script that leverages `vagrant` to quickly build clean binaries and libraries 
for use in an incident response investigation.

This will use a base Debian 11 (Bullseye) distribution to build the binaries.

Also includes `lsof` and The SleuthKit binaries.

## Install Vagrant


## Usage

First, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linkavych/linux_ir_tools.git
```

Next, run the `build_tools.sh` script.

The binaries will be compressed and placed in the $PWD.
